# CMS Portfolio

# Introduction 
I created this portfolio website to display my coding projects.
I wanted the site to be quickly updatable through a password protected content management system. 
I drew on all my learnings from Dev Academy Aotearoa's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp to create this project.

# Aim
To create a portfolio that can be updated using a content management system that's only accessible through authentication.

# Stack
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js

# Future Improvements
- Improved styling - I love the simple and clean look of my website however, I'd like to add more personality and interactivity on the front end.
- Tags - I want to filter the projects on the project page when tags are selected. I also want to improve the usability of the tag manager on the admin page.
- Blog - I want to add a blog where I can post learnings in different areas that interest me: coding, creative work and outdoor adventure.
